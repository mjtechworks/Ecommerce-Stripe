# Gatsby Ecommerce

## [Demo Store](https://ecommerce-gatsby.netlify.com/)

## üßê

This is a rewrite of [Sarah Drasner's Ecommerce Store with Netlify Functions and Stripe](https://github.com/sdras/ecommerce-netlify). Sarah's store was built with Nuxt. This version is written in Gatsby.

Check out Sarah's [blog post](https://css-tricks.com/lets-build-a-jamstack-e-commerce-store-with-netlify-functions/) on building the site, and where I also learnt how to use Netlify functions.

Gatsby is traditionally used as a static site generator. However, in this project the `/product` route is generated dynamically using the Gatsby createPage API. See [gatsby-node.js](./gatsby-node.js). To stop the client side router serving the 404 page on `/product` requests, I added a [server redirect](.netlify.toml) and a [rather obscure conditional check](./src/pages/404.js). Credit to [@samburgers](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/5329#issuecomment-484741119) because otherwise I would still be trying to solve this issue today.

The Context API and Local Storage were used for state management. Storing the cart locally means that the user can leave the site, return days later and their product selections will remain. Using the Context API with a dynamically generated route (`/product`) gave me a headache. I ended up following instructions for configuring Redux with Gatsby, thankfully the same approach worked. See [gatsby-browser](./gatsby-browser.js) & [gatsby-ssr.js](./gatsby-ssr.js) - both are required.

Local Storage doesn't exist when running Gatsby build as it's part of the browser API and Gatsby doesn't build in the browser. I read about various workarounds [here](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/309) and [here](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/14480), and then ended up [putting the code](./src/context/cart.js) in a useEffect hook to run when the component mounts.

[React Stripe Elements](https://github.com/stripe/react-stripe-elements) was used for the credit card component. It uses the higher order component pattern and doesn't currently support hooks (much sadness). Stripe was otherwise fun to use.
